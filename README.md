Welcome to Tipper.

You know when you're in a rush on your first date and you don't want to 
look stupid while trying to carry on a conversation and do complicated
math in your head?

Tipper is the answer to all your problems.

Simply rate the service according to "Good", "Great", or ":)" and
Tipper will calculate how much you should tip your server. Now you can
go ahead and talk to your date rather than looking stressed and confused.

Tipper took a little more than two hours to complete.

I completed all of the required stories as well as styling the app with
different colors, images, UI components, fonts and more!

Other than the code graciously provided by the instructors at Codepath,
no other open source code was used.

Simply download the zip file from Github, open the app in iTunes and 
follow the normal downloading procedures from there!
